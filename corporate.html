            <p>
              Our typography is a nice mix between modern, playful fonts and
              readible, sans-serif ones. For the headings (h1) and (h2) we
              chose the Google font "Barrio". It perfectly aligns with the
              personality of the brand, as we want to represent the cheerful,
              active behavior of dogs. It also matches perfectly our
              illustrations strategy. This combination of visuals creates a
              pleasing cartoonlike image.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the smaller headings (h3), (h4), and (h5) we used "Segoe UI"
              font in bold verion, provided by Bootstrap. It is sans-serif
              font that is easily readible. Its clean design is the perfect
              choice for digital and screen-based content, just like our
              website. For the body text we adopted the same font, "Segoe UI",
              in regular and light version.

            <p>
              The grid system of the website consists of the twelve column
              system of Bootstrap. In order to achive intersting web design,
              we incorporated different UI elements. They include - multiple
              types of cards, pop-ups, and accordion components. All of these
              UI elements were taken from Bootstrap and were changed according
              to our style guide.

                    Having dogs can sometimes be a challenge, but it’s even

              The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              The navigation structure of "Doggify" is designed to provide
              users with an easy access to different sections of the site. The
              first page that the users can access is the "Home page". There
              are links to several pages. The comminuty of Doggify can be
              reached by clicking the "Blog" link in the navigation bar. Users
              are also able to create a profile in Doggify, or log in their
              already existing ones. The profile is needed once the customer
              has paid the suscribtion fee, so they can easily book a new
              service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another section that can be discovered from the home page is the
              "Find a dog sitter" page. First the user has to fill in their
              details in the search bar, situated in the hero section. Then,
              they will be redirected to the "Find a dog sitter" page, where
              they will get results based on their filters. There they can
              choose between different dog sitters. In case they want to
              contact any of them, they have to click the "contact" button on
              the sitter's profile. A pop-up with additional information about
              the sitter appear. Then, the user can choose if they want to
              book them or not. If yes, the user is redirected to the payment
              page, where they can fill in their billing data.

            </li>
            <p>
              Our testing had several goals. First, we wanted to learn if the
              website delivers user-friendly experience. While we were
              creating it, we wanted to achieve an easy to navigate design. As
              our website has very clear goal - to find a dog sitter- we
              wanted to know if the function is simple enough. Second, our
              website has the goal to connect dog owners, especially
              internationals in the Netherlands. By our research, we wanted to
              check if our "Blog page" helps people connect, share experiences
              and feel like part of a community. Finally, we wanted to achieve
              a high-quality outcome, so the user testing had a goal to
              guarantee an excellent product.
            </p>

                  The test’s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with

                </li>
                <p>
                  The testing was done with four participants. All of them are
                  part of our target group - internationals and Dutch dog
                  owners, aged above 18 years old. The people that took part
                  in the testing were two Bulgarians, one Romanian, and one
                  Dutch, aged 20, one 26, one 21 and one 28 accordingly. They
                  are all owners of different kinds of dog breeds.
                  Additionaly, all of the participants and currently living in
                  the Netherlands.

                </li>
                <p>
                  The testings were done in different ways. Three of them were
                  done in person and one online, via Microsoft Teams. The ones
                  that were conducted in person were done in various home
                  locations. Three of the testings were conducted on a laptop
                  and one on mobile phone. The questions were asked by one
                  moderator.
                </p>
                <li>
                  The test’s <strong>protocol</strong> (what instructions are

                </li>
                <p>
                  The testing started by asking each of the participants for
                  approval to record. We voice-recorded all of the testings
                  and took pictures of some of them. First we gave them a
                  background information regarding our project:"For our
                  university project, we, as second-year students studying
                  Creative Business, have been assigned to develop a
                  functional website targeted towards dog owners. One of our
                  goals is to help internationals and Dutch dog owners to
                  create a strong community and help each other."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, we asked them to introduce themselves shortly - to say
                  their name, age and nationality, so it can be clear that
                  they are part of the target group. After that we asked them
                  the following questions:
                </p>
                <p>
                  What are your first impressions about this website?<br />
                  Can you find a dog sitter and book them, based on you dog
                  characteristics?<br />
                  Can you find more info about dog walking?<br />
                  Can you add a new article in the blog?<br />
                  What are your overall thoughts about this website?<br />
                  Is the website easy to use?<br />
                  Is there something you would change?<br />
                  Would you use it yourself?
                </p>

                  <strong>
                    Based on the received answers we asked additional

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been
                  identified, ranked by importance.
                </li>
                <p><strong>Positive aspects</strong></p>
                <p>
                  1. Easy to navigate website - The participants found the
                  website's structure clear and logical.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Catchy, memorable design, in particular illustrations and
                  colors - The participants found the design to be easy to the
                  eye. They also made a remark that it reminds them of a dog
                  personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Provides people with any information related to dogs -
                  that makes it encouraging for people to share resources.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Negative aspects</strong></p>
                <p>
                  1. The button "add an article" is hard to find - The
                  participants couldn't see it at first.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. It is hard to tell if you add things successfully or not
                  - When the participants tried to add article, comment,
                  create a profile or sign in, there is no indication is it's
                  successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. The is no profile page - after loging in/sign up the
                  participants didn't know what happens with the profile.
                </p>

            Context of campaign and promotional activities
          </h4>
          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>
            Doggify is a website that connects dog owners in the Netherlands. The main function of the website is to
            find suitable
            pet-sitting options for the dogs of mainly internationals, but Dutch people are also welcome to join the
            community. In
            return for 20 Euro per month, the customers have access to dog owners that offer temporary housing or pet
            care
            services. In addition to this, useful information can be found through interaction between dog owners in the
            form of a
            blog. This information is related to breed-specific questions or common problems such as housing, relatable
            to expats.
          </p>
          <h5>Vision</h5>
          <p>
            “In a world where emotional and practical support is rare to find away from home, we believe everyone
            deserves
            assistance in tough moments, because success is only built through teamwork.”
          </p>
          <h5>Mission</h5>
          <p>
            We as Doggify fight to make a drastic difference and reshape the idea of foreign big dog ownership, making
            it not just barely manageable but truly rewarding.
          </p>
          <h5>Values</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Community:</strong> We aim to create a safe space where expat dog owners can not only bond over
            breed
            specifics but, above all, find a sense of belonging and make long-lasting friendships among kindred spirits.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Empathy:</strong> We understand the challenges that foreigners face when bringing their furry
            friends to a new country. Doggify is a platform that inspires them to connect and sympathize with each
            other. Our approach is to address their various needs with genuine care, ensuring a welcoming experience
            filled with understanding and warmth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Shared Responsibility:</strong> We encourage big dog owners to actively contribute to the well-being
            of the
            community and its members. Doggify centers on collective action by offering dog care assistance, including
            sitting and
            walking, and sharing knowledge and resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cultural Inclusivity:</strong> While Dutch organizations often use language and policies that
            inadvertently
            isolate internationals, at Doggify, we thrive in an international environment. Our platform welcomes all
            Dutch
            residents, regardless of background or origin, and deeply values diverse perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report aims to define and explain the process of promoting the brand Doggify. It will describe in
            detail all the
            stages that the team went through to communicate persuasively the brand to its target audience.
          </p>
          <h5>Communication Message and objectives</h5>
          <p class="fw-bold">Target audience</p>
          <p>
            Doggify’s target audience includes Gen X, Millennials, and Older Gen Z between the ages of 18-60. Doggify
            is mostly orientated toward international expats living in The Netherlands and owning one or more than one
            dog. While Dutch citizens are also welcome to join, we advertise the brand specifically as one tailored to
            the needs of internationals. The reason is that when you search up other companies on the Internet like
            <a href="https://www.petbnb.nl/">Petbnb</a>, <a href="https://www.pawshake.nl/">Pawshake</a>, etc., they are
            all in Dutch. This
            excludes a whole customer segment which makes up nearly 15% of the Dutch population, or 2.5 million people
            in total (Netherlands, n.d.). 18% of Dutch households have a dog (GlobalPETS, 2023). This means that 450 000
            expat dog owners in The Netherlands are not targeted with any specific brand/product yet. This gives us an
            opportunity for a highly lucrative business.
          </p>
          <p>
            What unites our target audience is dog ownership and migration from abroad. As we aim to create a community,
            we will not segment that target audience per age and dog size/breed. We want the target audience to be broad
            enough to be populated by the brand to as many customers as possible. This, however, means we have to take
            into account all the differences between generations so we can advertise in the most effective way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ou (2020) discusses the different perceptions of the dog in different generations. Younger generations like
            Millennials and Gen Z accept the dog as their child - preparation for their real child. While older
            generations like Gen X consider the dog as a ‘’valued family member’’. All generations unite under the
            benefit of the dogs as reducers of stress, loneliness, and anxiety. Based on the results of the research of
            Megna (2024), Millennials and Gen X are leading in the percentage of pet owners, in contrast to Gen Z who
            are in the last position after the Baby Boomers. Furthermore, Kelly (2024) discusses some of the reasons for
            this result. According to her article, the current economy and job market are sources of anxiety for Gen Z.
            Another reason is that some of the presenters of this generation are still studying at university which
            leads to lower income. In most cases, they rent an accommodation. The rules of some landlords who don’t
            allow pets, also influence the decision-making for Gen Z.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Generation X</p>
          <p>
            Generation X are born between 1965 and 1980, so they are around 50 years old. Kotler and Armstrong (2020)
            describe this generation as skeptical buyers and not very easily influenced by marketing pitches. On the
            other hand, they prefer quality over quantity. They also are very loyal customers once they find the brand
            they like. Most Gen X are pet owners which can be explained because they are in their careers and many of
            them own a home with a growing family. In other words, they have a stable lifestyle which led to taking care
            of dogs. Also, most of the presenters of Gen X are parents of already grown-up children. Kretzler et al.
            (2022) discusses the positive relationship between loneliness and pet ownership. That's the reason that some
            Gen X's take dogs to not feel lonely after their children move away.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Millennials</p>
          <p>
            Millennials are born between 1981 and 1995, so most of them are in their 30s. Kotler and Armstrong (2020)
            illustrate Millennials as a digitally comfortable generation. They are the first generation that grew up in
            a fully digital world. That is the reason that they can easily engage with brands on social media. However,
            due to rapid changes in the global economy, world events such as COVID-19, and several financial crises
            throughout the years, only about a third of millennials globally are financially secure (Millennials Are
            Falling Into a Depression Over Their Finances, 2023).
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Generation Z</p>
          <p>
            Generation Z was born between 1996 and 2012, so the people who are included in the target audience would be
            in their 20s. This is the generation that doesn’t know a world without the Internet. Hedges (2024) comments
            that social media is central to the life of Gen Z people. They shape their perspective through social media
            consumption. Some evidence for that is that “39% of Gen Z girls find shopping inspirations from social
            media.” (Kotler & Armstrong, 1972). Another characteristic of Gen Z is their free spirit and sense of
            exploration. Hedges (2024b) states that this generation likes to travel and it’s their priority compared to
            previous generations. That makes it difficult for people of those ages to take care of a dog because
            sometimes it’s difficult to travel with it or just to leave it to someone. Expect the unstable financial
            state and living conditions, the urge for traveling explains the low percentage of dog owners amongst this
            generation.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Platforms</p>
          <p>
            In 2024, there are estimated to be 5.04 billion total social media users worldwide” (Statista, 2024). The
            image below illustrates this percentage compared to Internet users.
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/Social-media-users-table.png" style="max-width: 512px">
          </div>
          <p>
            However, out of those 5.04 billion, Facebook is considered the most used social media worldwide. According
            to Wiley (2022), 75% of Generation X use social media. The main preference amongst their presenters is
            Facebook, followed by YouTube. On the other hand, ‘’Millennials are the most active demographic on social
            media” (Zote, 2024). The top 3 most used social media platforms by this generation are Facebook, Instagram
            and YouTube. Zote (2024) commented that Gen Z spent daily the most time out of all generations on social
            media. They may have visited in the last few years TikTok the most, but as their favorite social media, they
            chose Instagram.

          <h5>Communication objectives</h5>
          <p class="fw-bold">Reach Objective</p>
          <p>
            To create a community where international dog owners interact with each other we need at least 50-100
            initial website users so this can be possible. A survey made by McKinsey showed that only 55% of all people
            who engage with a service actually end up subscribing, so half of those engaged should also be subscribed to
            our website (Ristagno, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why we aim to be seen by 800 people, 200 of whom are highly engaged with our content, so at least
            50-100 of them will sign up for our website.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Affect</p>
          <p>
            We aim to create content that evokes certain emotional reactions in our target audience. We want them to
            feel informed about the brand and be inspired by seeing a representation of them - expats with dogs. We want
            to pique their curiosity about the brand. They need to feel certain that our brand is something that doesn’t
            exist anywhere else because it is created specifically to help them and no one else. They need to feel like
            they are part of a community of like-minded individuals, that they are always supported by this community,
            and they can trust it, and that this is not just a money-oriented company but a platform where they finally
            belong. They need to feel excited to make new friendships and exchange tips & tricks with other
            international dog lovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team has produced those objectives based on the SMART method. Our goals are:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Specific:</strong> As mentioned, we have set a specific number of followers, engagement, reach, and
            subscription, and trying to evoke certain emotions in customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Measurable:</strong> We aim to be seen by 800 people, 200 of whom are highly engaged with our
            content, so at least 50-100 of them will sign up for our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Achievable:</strong> Our goals are realistic as they are not too high, and they are backed up by the
            aforementioned sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Relevant:</strong> The mentioned emotional reactions we want to cause are tightly related to our
            brand’s vision and values. Moreover, the number of followers, engagement, and reach we have set as an
            objective will lead to people subscribing to our website. The visuals planned to be incorporated into the
            social media content are stylistically similar to the overall look of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Time-based:</strong> The end date of achieving our goals would be 1st April. Then we would start
            analysing the data based on the content was created from the beginning of the accounts. After the data is
            analysed, we would improve the campaign for the upcoming months.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Response</p>
          <p>
            We aim to make the target audience consume our content and actively engage with it- this means liking,
            commenting, sharing, and reposting our publications. This leads to our ultimate objective - getting people
            to sign up for Doggify’s website as a response to our content.
          </p>


          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>
            Based on an almost 1-month social campaign that our team organized to raise awareness related to Doggify, we
            can come
            to several conclusions. Firstly, all objectives were reached so the campaign could be considered successful.
            Furthermore, Facebook and Instagram profiles reach slightly more followers than it was set. Secondly, the
            reach on
            Facebook was bigger than on Instagram. The team did not expect that difference because of the popularity of
            Instagram
            among society. Moreover, it can be said that Facebook has a more precise algorithm on the base of the high
            reach.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/facebook-reach.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/instagram-reach.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Thirdly, the team successfully justified the choice of social media platforms based on the age of the
            target group. Younger audiences prefer Instagram and people above 35 years are more active on Facebook.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/facebook-age.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/instagram-age.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            As a point of improvement, it can be mentioned in terms of the creation of content that more men must be
            attracted to
            the platform. It is visible that the main audience of the brand is women above 75% on both platforms. That
            need to be
            considered in the future planning of the brand.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            To sum up, the social media campaign was considered as every member of the team as successful, but there is
            always space
            for improvement. That's way in the future we will try to increase the reach and the engagement of the users.
            In
            addition, the team would try to increase the engagement rate of men and balance the chart between both
            genders.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also learned that social media is quite unpredictable. We had carefully planned all posts beforehand and
            some of them
            were quite similar, but they had different outcomes. For instance, we posted two community videos on
            Instagram. Their
            content was quite similar, only different sounds. While one of them gained only 700 views, the other gained
            1500+ views
            and 100+ likes. We learned that sound usage is crucial in reel-making, and that original sounds tend to get
            fewer views
            rather than widely used ones.
          </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>
            In the next stage of planning the content, we will take into account the posts had been planned but were
            never
            published, and the analysis of the data until this moment. Some of the posts that weren’t published are in
            the picture
            below.

          </div>
          <h5>Instagram Stories</h5>
          <p>
            In the future, the team will try to reach more and more users in Instagram through stories. Based on the
            data of March – stories reach the least reach from users. In order to increase the viewing of Doggify's
            stories, it would be created a quiz with interesting questions related to dogs. That would be fun and easy
            way people to interact with our account. Some of the questions can be seen of the pictures below.
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Another way to attract more people to watch Doggify's stories would be to create a challenge where users
            need to share their dogs on story and tag Doggify's account. Then more story viewings can be reached but
            also, new followers can be attracted because of the snowball effect.
          </p>
          <h5>Live streams on Instagram with experts</h5>
          <p>
            The team of Doggify will make sequel of live streams every month on different topic related to dogs. In this
            live stream professionals like vets, grooming experts and trainers will talk how dog owners can improve the
            life of their dogs. Live streaming is the most authentic and transparent form of communication between the
            brand and the audience. In addition, the live stream format is favoured by Instagram's algorithms. Doggify's
            followers will receive notification that the live stream is started and also it will be on the first
            positions of their feed.
          </p>
          <h5>Reels</h5>
          <p>
            Reels was the format that Instagram users engaged the most. Unfortunately, reels were the least content that
            was created. That mistake will be repaired and in the next period would be created more reels. Some of the
            reels would be with satisfied customers.
          </p>
          <h5>Events</h5>
          <p>
            On the 1st Birthday of the website, the team will organize an event where Doggify's community can see each
            other face to face. This will strengthen the community as customers will be able to share information about
            their dogs in person, and bond over all their similarities. There will be a Pookie Mascot as an already
            recognizable member of this society. People will be able to take pictures with him. Also, there would be
            many activities for both owners and dogs. After this big event, smaller events every few months.
          </p>
          <h5>Facebook</h5>
          <p>
            As it can be seen, Facebook users engage the most with single photo posts. That's why the marketing team
            will try to keep this engagement and even increase it. We will avoid posting too many photos at once and
            rather focus on just one picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we will create a Facebook post where people can share their photos of their dogs in the
            comment section. This, again, will show customers we are interested in them and their pets.
          </p>
          <h5>Instagram</h5>
          <p>
            Doggify’s Instagram followers engage the most with reels, and this is the content we posted the least on
            this platform during this marketing campaign. To achieve more reach and active engagement, we will create
            more reels with popular audio as original audio tends to attract fewer people.
          </p>
          <h5>Setting a precise time</h5>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, Doggify’s Facebook followers are the most active at 2-3 pm, and 8-10 pm. Doggify’s
            Instagram followers are the most active after 8 pm. We will aim to post in those time frames during the day,
            as by now, it is tested that we reach more people with this practice.
          </p>
          <h5>More frequent posting</h5>
          <p>
            So far, we have posted on average every other day. Posting every day will boost engagement even more, as
            people will see our content more frequently. This is why we will aim for regular everyday posting.
          </p>
          </p>
          <h5>Creating a Tiktok account</h5>
          <p>
            As reels produce a lot of reach and engagement, it would be a good idea to expand this video content to
            TikTok, one of the most trending social media among young people.
          </p>
          <h5>Diving deep into the target audience</h5>
          <p>
            After users sign up on the website, they will provide useful data at the time of their registration, such as
            dog size, dog age, and living areas in the Netherlands. Based on this, we will be able to analyze the data
            and conduct more specific research on our target audience. We will then be able to segment based on those
            characteristics and tailor our content to target those owners specifically, knowing their habits and needs.
          </p>



          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>
            The team chooses to promote Doggify on Facebook and Instagram. Instagram’s growth remains steady compared to
            other social media platforms. Dean (2024) explains that Instagram has more monthly active users than TikTok
            - 2 billion out of which the largest age group is 18-24 years old (Generation Z). In addition, Instagram's
            engagement rates are more than 4 times higher than Facebook's.
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/Social-media-engagement-rate.jpg"
              style="max-width: 512px">
          </div>
          <p>
            On the other hand, as was mentioned in the previous paragraph Gen X and Millennials are more engaged on
            Facebook while younger users from Gen Z prefer Instagram. Furthermore, according to West and West (2024),
            Instagram and Facebook are both platforms with the highest ROI (Return on Investment).
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/Social-media-ROI-table.jpg" style="max-width: 512px">
          </div>
          <p>
            After the team chose social media through which Doggify will be promoted, several precise objectives for
            each platform were set. They are based on our aforementioned communication objectives.

          <h5>Execution</h5>
          <p>
            The social media campaign was conducted on Facebook and Instagram. Diverse types of content were posted to
            understand better the interests of Doggify’s audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the content was published at different times of the day so the team could analyze at a later stage
            which time is the best to publish content. Moreover, the content is consistent. It uses the same types of
            illustrations and color schemes as Doggify’s website, so that a clear brand image is created, making Doggify
            more memorable and recognizable for the target audience.

          </div>
          <p>
            In the next lines, key strategies that were used during the campaign are explained.
          </p>
          <h5>Mascot</h5>
          <p>
            Inspired by some big brands like Kinder Pinguin, Nesquik, and HUB’s Buzz, we created our brand mascot –
            Pookie. Our team created Pookie for the audience to memorize better the brand. Most marketers use mascots
            for better brand awareness which is our brand’s communication objective. It draws the attention of the
            audience positively and even can provoke emotion which forms an emotional attachment to the brand. In a
            later stage, mascots can increase customer loyalty (Tycoon Success Business Magazine, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we created a short funny Instagram and Facebook commercial with our mascot. This commercial
            aimed to pique the target audience’s curiosity, boost engagement, and evoke positive feelings.
          </p>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/2427079700825491" target="_blank">Link to commercial here.</a>
          <h5>Community reels</h5>
          <p>
            Creating reels was part of our campaign for several reasons. Firstly, it could reach a large number of
            viewers and attract more followers. Even if the brand has a low following thanks to the algorithm the reel
            can reach a wider audience (OPA Marketing, n.d.). That leads to better brand awareness and better traffic to
            the account. Secondly, our team created reels that describe the connection between our customers and their
            dogs. That creates a better image of the brand because we engage our customers in our campaign not just
            record some models. In addition, the reels can evoke emotions of community, our main value, in the audience.
          </p>

          <h5>Associating with similar brands</h5>
          <p>
            At some point in the campaign, Doggify was promoted from a similar brand for dog services. That was a good
            act for the brand image to be associated with a bigger brand. Also, it attracts more followers for both
            parties, therefore it is better for creating a community.
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">

          </div>
          <h5>Giveaway</h5>
          <p>
            Doggify’s giveaway was in the form of 3 months free subscription and a Pookie plushie. The giveaway was
            created to increase the followers and engagement of the brand. While the other post users could scroll and
            just see it, if they participate, they need to put more effort into following the account, like the post,
            and tag a friend in the comments section. In addition, this increases brand awareness because they tag
            friends which leads to a snowball effect.
          </p>

            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./images/marketing/giveaway.PNG" style="max-width: 512px">
          </div>
          <h5>Getting to know the target audience</h5>
          <p>
            We posted stories on both Facebook and Instagram which included questions about our customers - how often
            they travel, what size their dog is, etc. We did this for three reasons. Firstly, this creates more
            engagement as the target audience will click on an option in each poll. Secondly, this is good for our brand
            image as it has a personal note- when the target audience notices we are interested in them as individuals,
            they are way more likely to engage with the brand and buy its products. This is also tightly connected to
            our main objective-building a sense of community. Thirdly, the results from those polls helped us analyze
            our target audience and the viability of the website.

          <p>
            The results were quite similar to the findings from the problem and solution interviews- most international
            dog owners have a busy schedule, travel relatively often, and need pet-sitting services once a week. This is
            a good sign for our product, as it is something that the target audience actually needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, we made an Instagram and Facebook story where the target audience could ask us questions. This
            aimed to alleviate the experience for the target audience as communication was now two-sided- we are not
            only interested in them, but we also are open to listening and communicating with them. This two-sided
            communication helps build a sense of community. The questions asked were subsequently answered through a
            Facebook and Instagram post, and later added as a “Frequently asked questions” section Doggify’s website.

          </div>
          <h5>Use of hashtags</h5>
          <p>
            On each Facebook and Instagram post, we took advantage of using hashtags so we can boost our reach. We
            created #doggify and used it on each post so we can establish the brand in social media. This way, we can
            connect with our audience more easily, get discovered by new potential fans, and track and curate what
            people are posting about our brand (Gillian, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, we added widely used hashtags such as #dog #dogs #doglover #petlovers #pets #brand #community
            #doggify #netherlands
          </p>
          <h5>Use of locations</h5>
          <p>
            To attract potential customers from The Netherlands, we used location tags for different regions, such as
            Amsterdam or Breda on both Instagram and Facebook posts. We also used the general tag The Netherlands.
            Location tags are known to boost posts’ reach and increase engagement (Location Tags and Geotagging for
            Discoverability - FasterCapital, n.d.).
          </p>
          <h5>Raising awareness</h5>
          <p>
            To fulfill this objective, we created informative Instagram and Facebook posts, where we explained the
            purpose of the brand, its features and price, we pointed out our competitive advantage, shared our vision,
            and shared our values. This way, our target audience is gradually getting to know us better so they can
            build trust in the brand.
          </p>
          <h5>Creating anticipation</h5>
          <p>
            Creating anticipation in the target audience is crucial as this makes people constantly come back and check.
            In our case, we aimed to create anticipation for the launch of our website. From creating “Coming soon”
            Instagram and Facebook posts to Countdown posts and stories you can add to your calendar, we wanted to make
            our potential clients curious and make the launch of our website a big event that is talked about a lot.
          </p>

          <h5>Face behind the brand</h5>
          <p>
            In order to create a sense of community and again, a feeling of personalization and two-sided communication,
            we made an Instagram and Facebook post where our team was introduced. Adding a human face also makes the
            brand more recognizable, humanizes the buying process, and overall makes the brand more trustworthy
            (Schwartz, 2021).

          <h5>Interesting facts</h5>
          <p>
            To pique the target audience’s interest and to establish the brand as one providing knowledge and useful dog
            tips and tricks, we created an Instagram and Facebook post with curious facts about dogs.

            After the social media marketing campaign is over, we can now analyze the data we received from both social
            media channels.

          <h5>Facebook</h5>
          <p>

            1,459 of this reach are accounts actively engaging with the brand’s posted content. This is 15 times more
            than our set objective. As mentioned above, 55% of all people who engage with a service actually end up
            subscribing, so half of those engaged should also be subscribed to our website (Ristagno, 2020). This makes
            Doggify’s potential subscribers shortly after its launch amount to 803, 8 times more than the expected
            initial 100 website subscribers, coming only from one platform.

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of trust-worthy people who would take care of the
                dog:</strong>
              Consumers are the most concerned with finding someone to take
              care of their dog when they are away from home, sick, or with
              extremely busy schedules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feeling of loneliness:</strong> No specialized
              communities here in the Netherlands where internationals can
              share, exchange, and socialize regarding their dogs. Either for
              daily dog activities or struggles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finding accommodation:</strong> Typical Dutch rental
              properties prohibit pets, which drastically restricts the
              options for dog owners to find accommodation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Language barrier in pet-sitting services:</strong>
              Internationals are unable to fully engage or understand the
              all-in Dutch dog services as they haven’t learned Dutch yet.
              This makes their accessing potential solutions hard to make use
              of.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Create a blog function where customers can share their
                struggles, and others can offer solutions, including providing
                them with resources about pet-friendly rental
                properties:</strong>
              This feature would allow for an exchange of valuable information
              and experiences among pet owners, helping them navigate the
              challenges of finding pet-friendly accommodations and other
              dog-related issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Establish specialized dog owner communities where everybody
                feels welcome and deeply values diverse perspectives:</strong>
              Such communities would foster a sense of belonging and support
              among dog owners, encouraging the sharing of advice,
              experiences, and resources that cater to the unique needs of
              diverse dog owners.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A dog community platform entirely in English, ensuring
                inclusivity and ending any uneasiness of feeling left out due
                to a language barrier:</strong>
              By providing a platform in English, internationals and non-Dutch
              speakers can fully participate and benefit from the community,
              ensuring that information and support are accessible to
              everyone, regardless of their language proficiency.

              <strong>Foreign expats with one or multiple dogs living in the
                Netherlands. All ages:</strong>
              This target group includes internationals from various
              backgrounds and ages, all sharing the commonality of living in
              the Netherlands with their canine companions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Owners of all types of breeds – small, medium-sized, and
                big:</strong>
              The service or product caters to dog owners regardless of the
              breed size, ensuring inclusivity and versatility in addressing
              the needs of all dogs.

              <strong>Brand Persona: Gergana is a 28-year-old expat in the
                Netherlands:</strong>
              She has a very busy schedule due to her job as a nurse at
              Erasmus University Medical Center. Despite having a relatively
              small circle of friends, she is an outgoing person. Describing
              herself as a creative and active person, one of Gergana’s
              biggest strengths is her organization skills which allows her to
              manage her time effectively amidst her busy lifestyle with a
              packed agenda. Teamwork is not something unusual to her, and she
              works effectively with other people. Gergana prioritizes safety
              rather than taking risks.

              <strong>This excludes a whole customer segment which makes up nearly
                15% of the Dutch population, or 2.5 million people in total
                (Netherlands, n.d.). 18% of Dutch households have a dog
                (GlobalPETS, 2023):</strong>
              This means that 450,000 expat dog owners in The Netherlands are
              not targeted with any specific brand/product yet. This gives us
              an opportunity for a highly lucrative business.

              <strong>International Friendly:</strong> Compared to other

              our services and the information we provide our customers with
              are entirely in English. Whereas when you search for other
              companies on the internet like Petbnb, Pawshake, etc. they seem
              to be in Dutch which makes the experience for internationals
              even harder.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Subscription Fees Model: </strong>It’s generated by
              selling continuous access to dog-care services. For a 20€ per
              month subscription fee, dog owners get access to owners who
              offer temporary housing or pet care services. Then the
              subscription revenue will be 8,342 x €20 x 12 = €2,002,080 per
              year.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advertising:</strong> Fees for advertising the brand.
              Through social media channels like Facebook and Instagram, we
              will display targeted advertisements and get income for
              pay-per-click advertisements. Per each click, we will get a
              certain amount of money. Based on research, we can earn €1,000
              each month from advertisement (Sabina, 2023). In one year it
              makes €12 x 1,000 = €12,000.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Merchandise Sales:</strong> In total, we will have

              justification of this number see the Validation of Assumptions
              page.

              When we organize two events with an entrance fee of €20 and
              assume 3,500 people attend then it calculates to €70,000 per
              event, so it’s €140,000 from events per year.

            Doggify is a website that connects all the international dog
            guardians in the Netherlands. For just 20 per month, dog owners
            get access to owners who offer temporary housing or pet care
            services. The best part is that dog owners get to make a friend
            who can show them a new cool calming trick, or maybe even explore
            the Dutch landscape with them. It’s all about community!
          </p>

          <p>
            It contributes to the value proposition specifically because of
            customization. Our product is precisely tailored to the specific
            needs of our target audience. After conducting several interviews
            and research on the topic, we concluded that international dog
            owners in the Netherlands don’t have a community where they could
            share their challenges, and seek mutual support regarding their
            dog. It gives a helpful solution to their worries, and we’ve taken
            into account many of them to create Doggify and make it as useful
            as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fit between the product and the brand identity is deemed
            strong. After conducting all of the interviews, all of the
            interviewees found Doggify unique and helpful for every
            international dog owner who struggles with finding a suitable dog
            daycare, or just a friend with whom they could share the same
            experience/challenges. They all thought that Doggify evokes a
            sense of community and inclusivity with its blog feature, and
            “English only” policy. Doggify’s brand identity represents exactly
            that. All of our interviews revealed that people are excited about
            the launch of the website, and would love to use it one day, as it
            solves a lot of their challenges like finding someone to take care
            of their dog while they’re on holiday, back home, or just having a
            busy daily life, and don’t have time to walk their dog. In
            conclusion, we can say that Doggify perfectly aligns with their
            needs and preferences.

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <h5>Assumptions</h5>
          <p>
            1. <strong>Subscribers for the next one year</strong> – 8,342: As
            the engagement is more important than followers and people who
            engage rather than just follow are more likely to subscribe we’ll
            use these metrics to assume how many subscribers we’ll have by the
            end of the year. As the engagement in Facebook and Instagram is
            almost the same and an average of 1,264, then for a year it’s
            12x1,264=15,168. A survey made by McKinsey showed that only 55% of
            all people who engage with a service actually end up subscribing,
            so half of those engaged should also be subscribed to our website
            (Ristagno, 2020). For us this means, that it’s 55% of 12,000 =
            8,342 subscribers.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            2.<strong> Revenue Streams:</strong> Merchandise Sales: Pet merch
            is a new trend that is developing more and more. After the
            pandemic people started adopting more and more, and according to
            statistics pet merch saw an increase of 1 Billion dollars annually
            (Industries, 2023). We’re all aware and it’s been proven that
            pet-owners love buying toys and clothing for their dogs. Trough
            selling branded merchandise we will stream revenue. It will be
            related to our dog care service and with our mascot visualized on
            it, such as dog clothes, toys, leashes, etc. This will also serve
            as a promotional tool and will be a direct sale. Research has
            shown that pet-owners love buying clothes for their pets, and 83%
            of Millennials are likely to spend money on merchandise for pets
            (Danziger, 2021b). Keeping in mind that our target audience
            doesn’t target a specific age group, and then we can assume that
            50% of our subscribers would be willing to pay for that.
            Consequently, 4,171 people will purchase at least one merchandise
            item, so 1,390 people per each item.

            -Toys: €10,- (1,390x€10=€13,900)<br />

            <strong>Conclusions interviews&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>&nbsp;</strong>All of the interviewees fit our brand
            persona. They’re all international dog owners living in the
            Netherlands, between the ages of 20 and 41, so we cover a big age
            group. They’re nationalities vary from Bulgarians, Romanians,
            Serbian, Slovenian, Belgium, etc.
          </p>

            <br />
            <strong> Problem interviews&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>&nbsp; </b>They all face similar problems – from struggling to
            find a place for their dog to stay when they’re traveling, to
            challenges to find other international dog owners, and befriending
            them. They all need support from people with a mutual lifestyle
            and also wish that there is a space where they can exchange tips
            and tricks regarding their dogs, and have trust in the people
            they’re leaving their dogs at. Other than that they want to
            socialize and be a part of something, because they’re usually with
            a very busy schedule and don’t have time to go out and meet new
            people. As they’re internationals and their main communication
            language here is English, they often face challenges with
            pet-sitting websites as many of them are in Dutch, and even if
            they also have an English version, most of the people there are
            older and speak only Dutch.

            <strong>Solution interviews&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>&nbsp;</b> When doing the solution interviews, we got feedback
            on our demo, and potential ideas for changes on the real product.
            While facing some challenges while navigating the website, they
            still thought that it’s easy to use and provides a lot of the
            needed information. The overall opinion is that they find the blog
            page hard to navigate, that some of the buttons were not available
            for example “add comment”, or finding where to ask questions.
            Those were little details that didn’t really bother their overall
            opinion and navigation through the website. The colors they
            associate with the website are either light brown or dark
            brown-ish, with the reason that they think of many dogs’ fur.
            Several also mentioned the color blue, which they associate with
            safety because they want to feel safe when they leave their dog
            with someone else. The interviewees think that the subscription
            fee is too low, and that we should increase it. The overall
            opinion is that the website provides people with something that is
            not yet on the market and that they would use it.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong> Pivot</strong>&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Our subscription price at first was €10. We thought that as a new
            brand going on the market, we shouldn’t start with a high
            subscription fee. As an unknown brand, we think that we still
            don’t have the audience’s trust and support and that we need to
            prove ourselves as worthy and qualitative of their trust and
            finances. During the testing of our MVP and the interviews, all of
            us were met with a totally different perception of the audience.
            Their opinion was that with all of the options, and opportunities
            we give to international dog owners in the Netherlands, we should
            charge an average of €30 to €40. Considering how expensive only a
            night stay for dogs at specialized hotels is, they think that a
            higher price is more suitable. Many internationals need our
            service, and the inclusivity we promote, so in their opinion
            increasing the price won’t make the chances for more subscribers
            low. We decided that it’s best to increase the price by €10, and
            make it €20, and not be as cheap. This will also help our revenue
            streams because as a new brand, we can never be sure of all the
            costs that we will have on the way. During our Production user
            testing, we increased the price, and all the testers didn’t mind
            the price of €20 per month. They were satisfied with the result
            and thought it was the perfect fit for price quality.
