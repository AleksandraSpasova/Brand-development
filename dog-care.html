      <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold text-center mt-2 mb-4"> Ultimate Guidelines to Dog Care </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4"> When it comes to humans and dogs, we all have the same collective memory: You’re 7 years
      old and you just came home from your friend’s house across the street. You enter the front door in a rush, and you
      throw your school bag on the floor (spoiler: you’ll be punished for this later that night). Your mom immediately
      notices your unusual excitement, but you spit it out before she can even ask a question.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4">&nbsp;“Mom, I want a dog. Mariana has one and it’s adorable!”&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4">&nbsp;Your mom is too quick to brush you off. She tells you it’s a responsibility you’re
      not ready for. She tells you it’s a huge commitment. She tells you many other things, but at this point, you’re
      not even listening, and you go to your room in defeat.

      It only clicks years later, when you finally get the dog you’ve been dreaming of. Your mom, as always, was right.
      Welcoming a furry friend into your home is life-changing…and it does come with great responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4">&nbsp;Lucky for you, I’ve got you covered! In this guide, I’ll explore essential tips and
      practices for providing top-notch care for your beloved pet. </p>
    <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mt-2 mb-4">Nutrition</h2>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4"> As with humans, nutrition forms the foundation of a dog's health. So, opt for
      high-quality dog food that is appropriate for your pet's age, size, and breed. Select products with real meat as
      the primary ingredient and avoid fillers and artificial additives.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4">&nbsp;My Chihuahua Tony is addicted to the Royal Canin formula. If you also have a Tony at
      home, I highly recommend you introduce him to this brand. Disclaimer: This is not a paid partnership- it is just
      that good!

      On this note, even if you don’t have a Chihuahua, Royal Canin is great for smaller dogs of similar size and breed.
      Of course, it is advisable to first consult with this with your vet. They will determine the best diet plan for
      your dog's specific needs. </p>
    <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mt-2 mb-4">Exercise</h2>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4"> Regular exercise is key to keeping your dog physically and mentally fit. Aim for daily
      walks, play sessions, and interactive games to stimulate both mind and body.

      Make sure to first get to know your dog’s personality before buying any toys and games! For example, many Beagles
      need constant mental stimulation- get them the Outward Hound Hide N Slide Puzzle and watch them stay silent and
      occupied for hours. Tony struggles with separation anxiety and the only product that has ever worked is the KONG
      Classic Dog Toy.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4">&nbsp;Also, consider your dog's breed and energy level when planning activities- trust me,
      you do not want to take my Tony on a 5-hour hike.

      Most importantly, always ensure your dog gets enough exercise to prevent obesity and boredom. I know your
      grandparents tend to feed it a lot- and that’s okay! Just make sure you take it for a run outside after. </p>
    <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mt-2 mb-4">Grooming</h2>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4"> The most relatable dog trait is their desperate need for spa days! Establishing a
      grooming routine early on will help keep your dog looking and feeling their best. Grooming plays a vital role in
      maintaining your dog's hygiene and appearance. Brush your dog’s fur 2-3 times a day to prevent mats and tangles
      and bathe them at least once a day using dog-friendly shampoo. Trim its nails, clean its ears, and brush its teeth
      to prevent dental issues. I usually do this all by myself, but you can do that in a professional salon. However,
      this can be a tricky endeavor as not many of those salons are English-spoken. If you know such, please let me know
      in the comments below! </p>
    <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mt-2 mb-4">Veterinary Care</h2>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4"> Frequent trips to the doctor are crucial for keeping an eye on your dog's health and
      identifying any potential problems early on. As advised by your veterinarian, schedule yearly wellness
      examinations, immunizations, and treatments for parasite prevention. To make sure your dog gets the care they
      require, take the initiative to address any health issues or behavioral changes as soon as they occur.

      As it turns out, your mom was right the whole time- having a dog is, in fact, extremely challenging and
      hard-consuming. But if you look closely, you will notice your mom is the one who loves your dog now more than
      anything in the world. She loves it to the point of overfeeding it and asking about it on the phone rather than
      being interested in you. But hey, that is just most mothers’ love language.
    </p>
    <p class="lead px-5 mb-4"> Having a dog is truly demanding, but at the same time, it is emotionally rewarding. If
      you learn to create a route and thoroughly follow all steps in the dog ownership process, you will soon start to
      love every minute of it.
      And always remember- your dog relies on you for its well-being, so prioritize its care and make every effort to
      provide it with the love and attention it deserves.
